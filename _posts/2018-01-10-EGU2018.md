Dear Colleagues,

we are pleased to invite you to the European Geoscience Union - General Assembly 2018 (EGU 2018) that will be held in Vienna (Austria), from 8 to 13 April 2018. We draw your
attention on the session: 

IE4.3/SSS13.73/AS5.19/BG1.20/ESSI1.8/HS11.4/NH11.13
Geostatistical and statistical tools to perform the data fusion of large datasets in geoengineering
and environmental studies
Conveners: D. Di Curzio, A. Castrignanò, A. Micallef, S. Rusi, G. Vessia, R. Viscarra Rossel

More information about the topic of this multidisciplinary session can be found [here](http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2018/session/28382) or on this [flyer](/assets/pdf/Flyer_IE_Big Data session_EGU2018.pdf).

The submission of abstracts is now open (up to 10 January 2018, 13:00 CET).

[Here](https://egu2018.eu/abstract_management/how_to_submit_an_abstract.html), you will find the guidelines for the abstract(s) submission. Financial supports are available for young researchers

Your participation and abstract submission will contribute to enrich the Geoscientist General
Assembly. You will be also able to exchange ideas, experiences, questions and proposals
with hundreds of geo-scientists on this topic and related ones.

Moreover, the full papers of selected abstracts submitted to this session and presented during
the EGU 2018 will be invited for possible publication on indexed international journal.
