The BONARES Conference 2018: “Soil as a Sustainable Resource” will be held 26–28 February 2018 in Berlin, Germany

[www.bonares2018.de](www.bonares2018.de)

The conference brings together researchers from all disciplines of soil science to discuss the functionality of soil ecosystems and how to develop strategies towards sustainable soil management. A sustainable bioeconomy requires integration of soil productivity with a wide range of other soil functions including nutrient cycling, carbon storage, water retention and filtering as well as being the habitat of a myriad of organisms and their activities. For sustainable soil management, we need to understand soils at a systemic level and to assess their value in a socio-economic framework.

Contributions (posters and oral presentations) to the following topics are invited:
1. Impact of agriculture and cropping systems on soil functions and ecosystem services
2. Effects of plant – microbe – fauna interactions on soil functions
3. Nutrient and carbon dynamics within the root zone as affected by soil management
4. Soil structure and water dynamics as affected by soil management
5. New sensing technologies, soil monitoring approaches and related decision support systems for sustainable soil management
6. Assessment and governance for sustainable soil management
7. Linking data and models in soil science – Towards efficient workflows for data-model integration
