Dear colleagues,

It is my great honor and pleasure to announce that the 4th Global Workshop on Proximal Soil Sensing (GWPSS2015) organized by Zhejiang University will be held in Hangzhou, China on May 12-15, 2015.

The theme of 2015 workshop is “Sensing soil condition and functions”. This theme has been chosen as it reflects new explorations and applications of proximal soil sensing (PSS). The workshop will provide a forum for researchers, professionals and engineers from all over the world to present their latest research and development results, and to exchange and share information and experiences in the fields of PSS, such as in situ measurement of soil properties, proximal sensing of soil carbon and biota, sensor data processing and fusion, sensor-based digital soil mapping, combing proximal and remote sensing, development of multi- sensor platforms, advances in soil electro-magnetic technologies, and new application of PSS.

The GWPSS2015 is sponsored by the IUSS working Group on Proximal Soil Sensing and Zhejiang University (ZJU), co-sponsored by the Soil Science Society of China (SSSC), the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), the Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS-ISS), and the Nanjing Normal University (NNU).

We sincerely invite you to submit papers to and participate in the GWPSS2015. All presented papers will be published a proceeding of GWPSS2015. Selected papers will be recommended to WGPSS for review for possible publication on the journals.

Hangzhou, where the GWPSS2015 is to be held, has enjoyed a prosperous history of over 2,200 years. It is one of the most famous tourist cities in China, with its natural beauties and historical and cultural heritages. It is also famous for good-quality silk products and tasty Chinese food.

We are looking forward to seeing you in Hangzhou in May, 2015. We believe that you will enjoy the technical activities of GWPSS2015, as well as your stay in this elegant city.

Sincerely,
Prof. Zhou Shi
